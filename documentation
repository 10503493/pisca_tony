The project was carried out by a group of three members as part of  assignment. The objective of this project was to create an information system for any chosen domain, with or without GUI. Here the chosen system is an apartment rental. In which a registered user can search and book an apartment. Python flask is the integral part  of this web application as a framework, along with HTML5,CSS,Javascript and SQL.
